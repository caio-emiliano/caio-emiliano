# Hi, Caio Emiliano here! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaueMarques/kaueMarques/master/hi.gif" width="30px">

As a Data Scientist, I specialize in optimizing ML models using AWS technologies, including Textract and Rekognition. With a strong background in big data processing using Spark and expertise in Python and SQL, I provide effective solutions to tackle complex problems.

My extensive experience in data science encompasses the development of applications using AWS services such as Lambda, Sagemaker, Jupyter, and EMR. I possess proficient skills in debugging machine learning models for forecasting, NLP, and k-means clustering. Moreover, I have made significant contributions to computer vision research through my involvement in the PetrobrÃ¡s-funded PIBIC program. During this program, I developed algorithms for oil pipeline segmentation and analyzed performance metrics like IoU and minAP.

As an AWS Cloud Practitioner certified professional and a graduate in Computer Engineering from CEFET-RJ, I bring a solid foundation to my work. I am well-versed in agile development methodologies like SCRUM. Continuously learning and keeping up with the latest technologies and best practices in the industry, I have acquired a strong understanding of TensorFlow, Numpy, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

By combining my technical expertise, AWS proficiency, and commitment to continuous learning, I deliver high-quality results and contribute to solving complex data science challenges.
